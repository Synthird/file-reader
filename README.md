## Download/Installation

You can download a version in the [releases page](https://github.com/Synthird/File-reader/releases).

### Opening the exe in the zip folder (Windows only)

1. Download and unzip the zip folder called ```file-reader.zip```
2. Open the exe file in the unzipped folder
3. If you get a pop-up saying the exe might be a virus, just run it anyway

This is not a virus, so it is safe to install.
